/**
 * The indexer's capability signature answers one question for the index cache:
 * "would today's indexer have produced a different set of file records than the
 * indexer that wrote this cache?" The `cacheVersion` counter alongside it only
 * answers that when somebody remembers to bump it, and PR #175 — which taught
 * `isSourceFilePath` to admit markdown — did not. Every repository indexed
 * before it kept serving a map with no `.md` entries, so a request naming a
 * README or a skill matched nothing and the `no evidence` fail-safe forced the
 * premium tier on a one-line typo fix.
 *
 * So the signature is *derived*, not declared: we run the real eligibility and
 * classification functions over a fixed corpus of representative paths and hash
 * the answers. Admitting a new extension, dropping one, or moving a path to a
 * different kind all move the signature on their own. `cacheVersion` stays as
 * the manual escape hatch for extraction changes this corpus cannot observe —
 * richer symbols for an already-indexed file kind, say.
 *
 * Keep the corpus append-only in spirit: it is a probe set, not a test fixture,
 * and adding a path invalidates every existing cache. That is conservative in
 * the safe direction (a needless rebuild, never a silently wrong map), but it
 * is not free, so add a path only to cover a capability the corpus cannot
 * already see.
